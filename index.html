                    A vampire surivor-like game I developed in 2025 in Godot. <br /> It features
                    unique player abilities and weapons, procedually generated props and tiles, many different enemies
                    with various mechanics.<br /> It's a fully fledged game that I developed alone, including all the
                    programming, game design and the art.

                    Language Server Protocol implementation for Neovim, written in
                    Rust, that provides basic autocomplete features.<br />This project was a personal necessity to
                    me
                    since the official LSP from Godot did not have good support for neovim at the time, so I decided
                    to
                    write an LSP myself.

                    A work-in-progress RTS game in an outer space setting, with special
                    features such as formation-based abilities, a unique thrilling story, and proper real-time
                    action
                    where every split second counts.<br />Made using raylib and Odin with basically no other
